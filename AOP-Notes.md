# üß† Spring AOP - Quick Notes & Example

---

## üîπ What is AOP?

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is used in Spring to modularize cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transactions without cluttering business logic.

## üîß Common Pointcut Expressions

| Expression            | What It Matches                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `execution(...)`       | Method execution                                      |
| `within(...)`          | Methods within a package or class                     |
| `@annotation(...)`     | Methods annotated with a specific annotation          |
| `@within(...)`         | Classes annotated with a specific annotation          |
| `@args(...)`           | Method arguments annotated with a specific annotation |

## üîÅ Advice Types

| Annotation           | Timing                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| `@Before`            | Before method execution          |
| `@After`             | After method execution           |
| `@AfterReturning`    | After method returns successfully|
| `@AfterThrowing`     | After method throws exception    |
| `@Around`            | Wraps the method call            |

## üîÑ How Spring AOP Works Internally

1. Scans for `@Aspect`-annotated beans.
2. Creates advisors based on `@Before`, `@After`, etc.
3. Matches pointcut expressions to target beans.
4. Creates a proxy (JDK or CGLIB) for matched beans.
5. On method call ‚Üí proxy intercepts ‚Üí advice applied.

## üß™ Example Classes

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ LoggingAspect.java

```java
package com.example.aspect;

import org.aspectj.lang.JoinPoint;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.AfterReturning;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {

    @Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("‚û°Ô∏è Entering method: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
    }

    @AfterReturning("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void logAfter(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("‚úÖ Exiting method: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
    }
}


Spring AOP utilizes AspectJ's pointcut language to define where advice should be applied. Here are some commonly used pointcut designators:

execution: Matches method execution join points.
Example: execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..)) matches all methods in classes within the com.example.service package.‚Äã

within: Matches join points within certain types.
Example: within(com.example.service.*) matches all methods within classes in the com.example.service package.‚Äã

@within: Matches join points within types annotated with a specific annotation.
Example: @within(org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional) matches all methods within classes annotated with @Transactional.‚Äã

@args: Matches join points where the runtime type of the arguments passed have annotations.
Example: @args(com.example.security.Secured) matches methods where the arguments are annotated with @Secured.‚Äã

@annotation: Matches join points where the subject of the join point has the given annotation.
Example: @annotation(org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional) matches methods annotated with @Transactional.‚Äã

üîÑ Spring AOP Workflow: Step-by-Step
Aspect Detection: Spring scans for classes annotated with @Aspect during the application context initialization.‚Äã

Advisor Creation: For each advice method (e.g., methods annotated with @Before, @After, @Around), Spring creates an Advisor that encapsulates the advice and the associated pointcut expression.‚Äã


Proxy Creation: Spring determines which beans match the pointcut expressions. For these beans, Spring creates proxies:

JDK Dynamic Proxies: Used when the target bean implements at least one interface.

CGLIB Proxies: Used when the target bean does not implement any interfaces.‚Äã

Advice Application: When a method on a proxied bean is invoked, the proxy intercepts the call and applies the relevant advice in the following order:

@Around advice

@Before advice

Method execution

@After advice

@AfterReturning or @AfterThrowing advice, depending on the method outcome‚Äã



Method Execution: If @Around advice is present, it controls whether the actual method executes by invoking proceed().

üßµ Understanding Proxies in Spring AOP
Spring AOP is proxy-based, meaning it creates proxies for beans to apply aspects. Here's how it works:

JDK Dynamic Proxies: Used when the target bean implements interfaces. The proxy implements the same interfaces and delegates method calls to the target bean, applying advice as configured.‚Äã

CGLIB Proxies: Used when the target bean does not implement interfaces. CGLIB creates a subclass of the target bean at runtime, overriding methods to apply advice.‚Äã

The choice between JDK and CGLIB proxies is determined by the presence of interfaces and can be configured explicitly if needed.‚Äã

üß† Summary
Spring AOP uses AspectJ's pointcut expressions to define where advice should be applied.‚Äã


During application context initialization, Spring scans for aspects and creates Advisors based on the defined advice and pointcuts.‚Äã

Spring creates proxies for beans that match the pointcut expressions, using JDK dynamic proxies or CGLIB proxies as appropriate.‚Äã

When methods on proxied beans are invoked, the proxies intercept the calls and apply the configured advice in the correct order.‚Äã

This mechanism allows for modularizing cross-cutting concerns like logging, transaction management, and security, keeping the core business logic clean and focused.‚Äã
